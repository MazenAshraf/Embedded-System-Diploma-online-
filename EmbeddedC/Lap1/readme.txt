<<< Creating a baremetal SW to run on ARM Versatile PB on vitural platform qemu to send a string using UART >>>

1-I wrote a startup and linkerscript
2-using gcc commands i got app.o and uart.o from app.c and uart.c and uart.h included in both of them
3-Making linker linking all object files using linkerscript
4-Using Arm cross-toolchain to generate a hexa file to burn it on virtual platform on qemu called "ARM Versatile PB"
